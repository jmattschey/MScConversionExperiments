# Choosing an Experiment for your Research Project

This book will discuss some research paradigms and commonly used types of experiments. Each experiment will be accompanied by a finished experiment file and/or the materials required to create the experiment. We will primarily focus on tasks that run in Open Sesame and questionnaires we can use on Qualtrics.

## How to use the Experiment Library

Each task you will see included will have a Open Sesame file and/or Qualtrics file attached to it. You can download these files and use them to test participants. Chapter 10 and 11 tell you more about how to use Open Sesame and Qualtrics.

This Experiment Library was designed for Psychology students at the University of Strathclyde. If you are a student at the university, you will have access to all files. 

If you are not a Strathclyde students, you are still welcome to use these resources. However, some will be password protected due to copyright issues. If you use any of the experiments, please acknowledge the source of the experiment file by citing this Experiment Library.

## Accessibility

If you look at the top of this page, you will see a menu with several symbols. If you click on the A, you can adapt the font to your needs and change the colour scheme. 
```{r Figure0-1, out.width = '95%', fig.align = 'center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Click on the A to find alternative fonts and colour schemes'}

knitr::include_graphics('images/accessibility.PNG')
```

It is also possible to search the Experiment Library from that menu and to download the book as epub or PDF. Please note that while the epub and PDF version contain most Figures, these versions do not currently include any Figures in gif format. If you notice a reference to a Figure that is not contained within these versions, it is likely to be a gif that you will be able to view in the online version.
