Each experiment will be accompanied by a finished experiment file and/or the materials required to create the experiment. We will primarily focus on tasks that run in Open Sesame and questionnaires we can use on Qualtrics. 1.1 How to use the Experiment Library Each task you will see included will have a Open Sesame file and/or Qualtrics file attached to it. You can download these files and use them to test participants. Chapter 10 and 11 tell you more about how to use Open Sesame and Qualtrics.
