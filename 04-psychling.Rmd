## Lexical Decision Task

Lexical decision tasks require participants to identify whether a word they are presented with is a real word (e.g. "bird") or not (e.g. "quapbum"). 

**Formats**

The Lexical Decision Task is available for Open Sesame:

The timing of individual trials (e.g. display time for each sketchpad) was based on Laurence, Pinto, Rosa, and Macedo (2018).

The words and non-words used in the present task were generated using the [English Lexicon Project](https://elexicon.wustl.edu/). The restricted parameters were:

*For words:*

- Word length: 4 to 10 letters
- Number of orthographic neighbours: 4 to 6
- Log of Frequency of a word as reported by the HAL Study: 8 to 15
- Concreteness Ratings: 4 to 5
- Emotional Valence: 0 to 4
- Emotional Arousal: 0 to 5
- Number of Syllables: 2 to 5
- Query Scope: Restricted ELP Lexicon

*For non-words:*

- Word length: 4 to 10 letters
- Orthographic neighbors that a word has: up to 15
- BG_Freq_By_Pos: 4750 to 5000
- NWI_Mean_RT: 200 to 1000
- NWI_SD: up to 700
- Obs: from 10
- NWI_Mean_Accuracy: from 0.6

These restrictions produced a list of 30 words and 30 non-words. [Click here for an overview of their characteristics](link here to excel file)
